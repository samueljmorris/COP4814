How to run

API Key Generation

Before your first use, you need to get an API key from Flickr. You can obtain one by:

Log into your Flickr account.

Go to this link: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/

Flickr will provide you with both an API key and a "secret" value.

Copy both of these into a new file and call it keys.json.
